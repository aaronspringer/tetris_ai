# Machine Vision AI Bot

This is the start of a machine vision AI to get a high score in my school's tetris game.


## Status

I have gotten through the machine vision part, and can accurately convert the tetris game on screen into a 2D array of letters ZSJLOIT representing each tetromino, and a seperate letter corrosponding to the next available piece.


## Next Steps

- Create a seperate environment to train the model with, as the actual game can't run as fast as needed for training
- Train the model to create a pro tetris player.
- Possibly move off of OpenAI's Stable-Baselines3 PPO algorithm and write my own PPO.
